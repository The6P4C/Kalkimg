# Kalkimg
Convert images to the CASIO C2P format for the fx-CP400 (Classpad II) calculators.

## How To Use
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/The6P4C/Kalkimg/releases) and download **both** the `dll` and `exe` file. Put both files in the same directory (your Downloads folder will work!) and double click the `exe` file.
